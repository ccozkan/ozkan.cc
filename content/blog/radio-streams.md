Years ago, I downloaded all my music and then like everybody else I switched to streaming. Listening tunes from youtube and spotify has its advantages. But I decided to take a step away from it.

There are two reasons behind that escape plan
1) listening same stuff over and over again
2) all the "explored" music is been recommended by the algorithm

Listening music on radio feels way more organic, and has a bit of of surfing taste. Since I can change stations, but have no control on what song to play. Having able to all the control on the music, makes me want to control everyti

**pro-tip:** To find the streaming url of a radio station. Check the network-tab in developer tools in Firefox/Chrome and run away with the streaming url (check type media or cause media, if its too crowded) of a station I like. For storing and listening, I use [radiotray-ng](https://github.com/ebruck/radiotray-ng).

__edit:__
It has been 7-10 days that my primary tune source is online radio. I've realized using spotify turned me a some kind of control freak. Whenever I get the taste of good music, I think about adding it to my playlist, so I can own it and not lose it forever. Of course there are times I write down the song playing for listening later but it is quite quite less.  Being in control of playing music all the time is a bit tiring activity. Letting the song play and enjoying the track is not. I've also realized even though I  was listening variaty of music on spotify, the variety of the tunes that you can listen on online radios are wider. Well, it is all about the surfing taste in the end.
