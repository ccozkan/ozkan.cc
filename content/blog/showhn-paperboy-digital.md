As you might know people present their projects(might be fresh start-up or just a side project) on ["HackerNews Show"](https://news.ycombinator.com/show). I developed a web-app, that collects projects listed on ShowHN, and sends users to in a weekly newsletter. App checks for new projects using [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). In order to users to receive newsletter delivery, they must confirm their email. In case if anyone changes mind, unsubscription link is present at the footer of newsletters.

I believe this project can also be used by communities for delivering its members an autogenerated weekly newsletter. Few tweaks and changes should be done for this case on the showhn.paperboy.digital. I made a video about this subject and general overview of the project. You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFnIwpRUnTE).
