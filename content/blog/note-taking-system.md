I believe it has been about couple of years since I met ith the concept of GTD note taking system. It is a system introduced by David Allen in 2001 by its book. I am not going to introduce and explain the system but it is quite straight forward. There is his book, also quite a lot of resources like podcasts, videos, presentations of him explaining the system.

I haven't used the system for 2-year streak. But I felt better and organized and spent the time well, whenever I was using it and cleaning my "inbox". Being organized kept my mind more free.

There are other note taking systems and approaches. One I know is Bullet Journal. I also think trying that out sometime.
