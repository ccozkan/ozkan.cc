So I've been working on my latest side project from time to time. It is an open-source web app for listening podcasts with features. I believe it would be nice to have a full featured, free and open source podcast web app around.

Also first time in one of my side-projects I am experiencing Test Driven Development, which is kind of fun🎉.

Here are the promises I've made on [its github page](https://github.com/ccozkan/cafe_podcast).
