I wrote about importance of note taking systems [before](/blog/content/note-taking-system/), in that blogpost I pointed out that my way-to-go note taking system is GTD by David Allen. I use Emacs Org-Mode as my tool in that approach.

I have a Dropbox folder which is in sync with my cell phone (check beorg in iOs, orgzly in Android). I also wrote a Telegram bot for capturing and appending them to the inbox.org file.

What I feel about how I adapted the system is maybe too digital dependent. However the work I done, the media I consume (watching, reading(except books), listenin) I'd say 85% is on computer. But still I might add some analog writing and keeping the stuff to my adaptation.
