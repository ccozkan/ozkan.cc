I believe using a note-taking, time and task management system is quite important. It reduces the load on the brain therefore it becomes more free. Surfes on ideas, and trusts the system on not forgetting them.


I believe it has been about couple of years since I met ith the concept of GTD note taking system. It is a system introduced by David Allen in 2001 by its book. I am not going to introduce and explain the system but it is quite straight forward. There is his book, also quite a lot of resources like podcasts, videos, presentations of him explaining the system.

I previously talked about importance of note taking systems, in that blogpost i pointed out that my way-to-go note taking system is GTD by David Allen. I use Emacs Org-Mode as my tool in that approach.

I have a Dropbox folder which is in sync with my cell phone (check beOrg in iOs, orgzly in Android). I also wrote a Telegram bot for capturing and appending them to the inbox.org file.

What I feel about how I adapted the system is maybe too digital dependent. However the work I done, the media I consume (watching movies, reading posts) I'd say 80% is on computer. But still I might add some analog writing and keeping the stuff to my adaptation.
