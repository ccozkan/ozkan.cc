I have a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I was doing my PhD in that area. But then I realized I’ve got some solid passion in software and web development. So I quitted my job, dropped my PhD and now I’m using my mad coding skillz for my job:D

Other than that, I like hiking in nature, playing some classic rock on guitar and watching kung-fu movies.
