I have a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I was doing my PhD in that area. But then I realized Iâ€™ve got some solid passion in software and web development. So I quitted my job, dropped my PhD, moved to my hometown in order to radically change my professional career. Currently I work as a Ruby on Rails Developer. Aside from my working hours, I try to keep few side-projects of my own going on.

In digital world, I like Linux(i use arch btw), Ruby(and Rails), Python, both Emacs and Vim, Raspberry Pi and would like to learn Rust. In analog world, I like hiking, camping, playing guitar, drawing caricatures and would like to learn wave surfing.
