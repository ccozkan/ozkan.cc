      <description>I believe it has been about couple of years since I met ith the concept of GTD note taking system. It is a system introduced by David Allen in 2001 by its book. I am not going to introduce and explain the system but it is quite straight forward. There is his book, also quite a lot of resources like podcasts, videos, presentations of him explaining the system.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t used the system for 2-year streak.</description>

      <description>So I wrote about changing my primary listening music source from spotify to online radio streaming before. It is now somewhere around day10-day15 of this experiment, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some more thoughts. In these days, I turned up a station whenever I want to have some rhytmic and melodic sounds in the air. Sometimes I opened spotify or youtube just for listening specific songs. I&amp;rsquo;ve never to let it play on its own.</description>

      <description>RSS might not be the newest technology in town. But damn it is effecient.
In the age of noice of push notifications, this not disturbing delivery system has became how i consume the internet. From independent blogs (the non-kneelers part of social internet!),to big major publisher sites, podcasts and a lot of other platforms(reddit subreddits, youtube channels, etc) have native rss support. Some additional tools provide rss for non-supporting ones.</description>

      <description>Years ago, I downloaded all my music and then like everybody else I switched to streaming. Listening tunes from youtube and spotify has its advantages. But I decided to take a step away from it.
There are two reasons behind that escape plan
 listening same stuff over and over again all the &amp;ldquo;explored&amp;rdquo; music is been recommended by the algorithm  Listening music on radio feels way more organic, and has a bit of of surfing taste.</description>
